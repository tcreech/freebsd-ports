 Warning: fwupd is highly experimental and DANGEROUS

 The fwupd utility is currently highly experimental on FreeBSD
 and may be unstable or unsafe to use.
 Proceed with caution - flashing firmware carries a significant
 risk of rendering your device unusable (“bricking”).

 Only attempt to flash firmware if you are prepared to accept
 this risk.

 If you successfully flash a device — or encounter a failure —
 please send a detailed report to decke@FreeBSD.org

 Include information about your hardware and the firmware you
 attempted to flash. This feedback will help track which devices
 work correctly and which do not.

pam-afs-session is a PAM module that isolates each login in a separate AFS PAG
(so that they will not trample on each other's AFS tokens) and supports either
running an external program to obtain AFS tokens from a Kerberos ticket cache
or using Heimdal's libkafs library. It does not obtain tickets itself and must
be used in conjunction with a Kerberos PAM module to obtain tokens (setting up
PAGs can be done without any Kerberos implementations). It provides only the
setcred and session PAM functions.

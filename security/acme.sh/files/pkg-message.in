{ type: install
  message: <<EOM
This script will create the following directories if they do not exist:

 ~acme/.acme.sh
 ~acme/certs

The script will also install ~acme/.acme.sh/account.conf.sample which has
sane defaults.  Copy this to ~acme/.acme.sh/account.conf and edit contents
to suit.

In the %%EXAMPLESDIR%% directory, you can find the dnsapi 
scripts which will be useful if you decide to use dns-01 challenges. Also 
included are the deploy scripts.

A newsyslog.conf sample file is installed at 
%%PREFIX%%/etc/newsyslog.d/acme.sh - you must modify it by
at least uncommenting the line.

If you run `newsyslog -NC` it will create the required logfiles.

Please edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/cron.d/acme.sh changing:

* MAILTO - your email address
* xx to the minute you want the cronjob to run
* yy to the hour you want the cronjob to run

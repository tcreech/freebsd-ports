+J  Creating 'configure'
+
+   Normally you can use the configure script provided with the OpenAFS release
+   tar file, but if you are patching the autoconf logic or building directly
+   from source pulled from the git repository you may need to (re-)generate
+   the configure script.
+
+   To create the configure script autoconf-2.64 or later and libtool-1.9b or
+   later are needed.
+
+   Running the script 'regen.sh' creates the configure script.  In addition
+   to creating the configure script, regen.sh will also, by default, build
+   the man pages, which requires the pod2man utility. Use 'regen.sh -q' to
+   skip building the man pages.
+
+   It is possible to create the configure script on one system to be used on
+   another. Ensure that the files created by 'regen.sh' are copied to the
+   target system.
